        <p>Creating an "Authentic Politician" app using Android Studio involves several steps. 
            The app can be designed to provide information about politicians, their work, and their authenticity. 
            Here's a high-level overview of how you can go about developing such an app. Remember to comply with 
            any legal or ethical considerations when creating an app that evaluates the authenticity of politicians. 
            Additionally, consider the privacy and data protection regulations in your region or the regions your app 
            will be available in. This is a general roadmap for creating an "Authentic Politician" app.</p></div></li>

                    <p>This project is compulsory as it is part of the college syllabus and as a core subject. The reason behind
                        this system is that I’ve developed a new system that can help to reduce the paper work of a pet shop. So I
                        decided to develop a Pet shop Management System as my DBMS project. PHP is great for developing systems.
                         Most of the back-end class is built by PHP. For the database that
                        used to store data of the system, I use MySQL Server and as for the connection I use PHP PDO
                        connection to bridge-up PHP pages and MySQL server for data retrieving. Although the result isn’t as 
                        perfect as I planned, but the overall outcome is much satisfied as most of the
                        features which I planned have been successfully implemented into the system.
